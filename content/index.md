title: Welcome to Aura

#### What is this wiki?

This wiki provides a *private* insight of my world building project: **Aura**. This mythical fantasy-like realm will be the first setting of my book series, The Cretovian Chronicles, and of any book or game series that may follow. If you know me, you know I really enjoy creation; music, games, business, worldbuilding, books... etc. I really hope you enjoy reading about it!

If you have the link to this wiki, you are special! I trust your opinions and I trust you will notice the hard work I put into this world building project. Throughout this wiki, you will see half finished work and incomplete thoughts jotted down that back link to nowhere. Please know this is my private workspace that I am sharing with you.

Feel free to have a look around! In addition to reading up on Aura lore, I could really use some help **proofreading** and **brainstorming**. This would include familiarizing yourself with this wiki, and reaching out to me with any suggestions on the following:
- grammar corrections 
- creative worldbuilding ideas (that add to the creation and lore of Aura)
- backlink insertions
- folder/page organization improvements
- artwork (as a visual guy that can't draw, I need tons of artwork)

#### Where to start:

A good place to start is reading about [[Aura]], [[The Creation Story]], and [[Theme, plots, series]], [[Cretovian Chronicles]], [[More on The Hither and the Eternals]], [[Character Story Arcs]]. There are a ton of folders with a ton of content and links to other pages. Enjoy!
