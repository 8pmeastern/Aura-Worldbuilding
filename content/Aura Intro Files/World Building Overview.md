I want Aura to be a beautiful diverse planet with magical and geo historic factors that effect landscape, environments, ecosystems, races, cultures, states and provinces. I really want to highlight nature throughout this world. The books will revolve around the [[Balmun]], and Simeon becoming the Beastmaster, so the animals, biomes, landscapes etc have to be super interesting.

I want there to be some brutality to this. Living in this medieval world should have extreme euphoric beauty displayed in nature, magic and fellowship of characters, and an extreme pain and agony displayed in destruction and death, riddled in the to-be war torn lands of Cretovia and its history.
