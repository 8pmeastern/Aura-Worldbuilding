the southern-most region of Eyuda main land. Claimed by multiple factions but no one can seem to keep it for long. They don't have the population to take care of it. Home to Stiffies, wild animals. Used to be part of the homeland of the Quigi and humans, but got overtaken by wild animals after the floods. The Lost city of [[Pelatia]] is said to be located within this region somewhere, but multiple expeditions have failed to find it.
