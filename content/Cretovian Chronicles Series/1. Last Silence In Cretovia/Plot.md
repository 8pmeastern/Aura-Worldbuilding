Plot for An End to Silence

3 perspectives: 

- Broldun is tasked by the King Sedrick of Cemork to convince to the King of Widghelf to send aide. Simeon assists him in this. When arriving at Widgehlef, the king says He will not support them as he is preparing for war. He is extremely paranoid and believe that all of the kingdoms are out to get him. The [[Balmun]] have been raiding his people in the night and he has reason to believe it is the Krilstuthians, as Dimonae, as. His various armies are preparing to march into Heighblin, even though they are neutral. (The second book will be about him trying to stop the war in the North)
- A human teen in Greymul, Capital of Dimonae joins the army to help the attack on the Tractzilian Krils. He is convinced (like most of the kingdom) that the Krils are a threat to the human race. The story follows his journey with the Dimonaen army through certain towns and small cites conquering them. He ends up changing his perspective over this journey because he sees how the Krils are just like the humans. 
- A Heighblin Kril who is a protector of his town about a 2 hour travel outside of the capital, gets pulled into the tension of war because he city is attacked by Nebulzian raiders and slave traders. These traders want to take him to Nebulzia, but he escapes them near the volcano. Travels to Tractzila city and sees they are preparing for war, and tries to convince the king this is not what their ancestors would want. He is a direct descendant of the old king of Krilstuthia, before the kingdom divided into two due to cultural differences.
