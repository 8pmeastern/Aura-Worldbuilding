Simeon works the [[Snow Throp]] fields high up on mountain top. 

Simeon is a boy (17) who has dreams of seeing Eyuda, and even distant places in Cretovia. His whole life he’s wanted to leave Mountain Top. He’s fascinated with beasts and nature, and keeps a sketchbook of every creature he encounters. 

After 

When he’s not plowing the fields, he frequents the Mountain Top Library, where he reads all about the Eyudan wild life, history, and peoples. 


Occasionally when he catches Broldun, the Pelitat Ambassador General to King Sedrick, he’ll give Simeon a sword lesson. 

“Show no mercy, for your opponent will not fail twice”

Chapter 3: (Simeon)

During a huge battle with the Cemork Army, [[Kolgör]] (avalanche) destroys the farm and mortally injures Simeon’s mother. Simeon could not save her because he hears a shrieking noise that nearly knocks him unconscious and makes his nose bleed. Before she dies, he tells him to stay strong and believe in the love of Creation that Cret put in his heart. After her death, Simeon’s father is broken down and begins to punch him, saying it’s his fault. Simeon wins the fight and puts a sword up to his throat. He spares his dad’s life. The Ice Colossus, believed to be wounded by fire balls from catapults, retreats into the icy depths of the [[Cryog Peaks]]. 

Because of the destruction of most of the farms surrounding Mountain Top, King Sedrick send messengers to the sounding towns (including the Kingdom of Dormiaan) for aide, and to the farms to save up on their rations. He also sends a party of soldiers lead by Broldun on a quest to the kingdom of Widghelf for aide. The Cemorkans are skeptical because Widghelf is so different from the Human kingdom it used to be. Before Broldun is sent out, Simeon notices the King whispers something in his ear. (It is later revealed that he gives him the instruction to seek out the aide of the Heighblin Krils if Widghelf denies aide, which Broldun has a history with. Humans have a rough history with Krils, dating back to the [[Empirical Era]])

Chapter 6: ([[Broldun]])






In a later book :
When Simeon comes back to Mountain top with his new found power to harness [[Astral Energy]] and speak to the [[Balmun]], he thrusts the [[Sword of Lost Souls]] into the ground, halting the path between the Ice Colossus and the rest of the townsfolk. He avenges his parents be defeating the Balmun, but instead of killing him, he balances his eternal spirits, and the Ice colossus peacefully returns to the Cryog Peaks.
