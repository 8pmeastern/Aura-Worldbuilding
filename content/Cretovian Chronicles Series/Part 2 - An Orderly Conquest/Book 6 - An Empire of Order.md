When The Death King has trouble keeping Eyuda in order, he is reminded that he used agents of Chaos to take what was his. Chaos will stay chaotic. In fear of chaotic change after he finally got what he believes is rightfully his (all of Cretovia) He enlists Slán’s perennials to help with this issue. They prove more troublesome then help. 

At the end of the book, the Zang slo turn on the death king because they were promised Eyuda (but it was taken away from them due to their inability to keep order). This results in a civil war between the POOC, now in line with slans forces, vs the Zang-slo who are joined by Rems forces (due to their chaotic nature and love for it).
