### The Astral Realms (0A)

In ancient lore, [[Cret]], [[Rem]], and [[Slán]] were the first Beings, known as [[The Three Eternals]]. They always were and always will be. They are one and the same, constructed of [[Pure Spirit]] and [[Astral Energy]], organized into the 4th Dimension known as [[The Hither]]. 

At the beginning of time, Cret, Rem, and Slán utilized their [[Eternal Spirits]] to create the [[Astral Realms]] of [[Abundance]], [[Dysfunction]], and [[Perfection]]. 

These realms could foster consciousnesses known as [[Aliyata]] - beings created entirely from [[Spirit]] to help fulfill the Eternal’s purposes. They were direct extensions of the Eternals, gifted with great powers to influence spacetime and never die. 

Rem and Slán use their Aliyata to battle one another as they have always been fundamentally opposing forces, in a war known as the [[Endless Astral Conflict]]. Cret saw no interest in fighting, but rather to find find purpose through his creation. 

Cret felt that there was little meaning in The Hither because Aliyata don’t have Free Will  to choose their destiny, as every 4D being transcends spacetime, and they lack proper Reason due to their inheritance of their creator’s [[Eternal Belief Structure]]. Cret decided he wanted to create a world with physical laws that limit power and maximize Free Will and Reason, which will allow beings to find a purpose. Cret wanted to create a world so its beings could experience time, free will and emotion, on their own. He believes that choosing one’s destiny gives one’s life meaning at its fullest, and that this meaning can only be revealed in a third dimensional being made of [[Matter]]. By creating these beings, guiding them towards their unique purpose, and preserving their uniqueness, Cret fulfills *his* purpose. 

Thus, the 3D world of [[Aura]] was created.

### The Age of Unity (AU)

In Aura, Cret created the lands of [[Lunelvín]], [[Artembia]], and [[Cretovia]]. He made these lands full of awe inspiring landscapes and jaw dropping beauty.  Hundreds of thousands of species of plants and animals inherited the lands, handcrafted by Cret himself. These beings had a type of creaturely free will, but lacked any amount of reason to develop a purpose, and fully utilize the free will they were given. 

Cret knew that in order for a being to have free will *and* reason, they need to have some proportion of each of the eternal’s [[Eternal Spirits]], so they could choose. Through this, they could choose to encompass Creative, Chaotic, or Orderly values.

Cret needed Rem and Slán to get in on the action. The two Eternals wanted nothing to do with Aura at first: Rem thought Aura’s Physical Laws were too structured, and Slán saw Free Will as too chaotic and unpredictive. He convinced them to join in by allowing them to create their own lands on Aura however they see fit. This lead to the creation of [[Reltrome]] and [[Flyígan]]. 

In return, the Eternals would combine their spirit to create [[The First Beings of Aura]]. These beings were equal parts Creation Spirit, Orderly Spirit, and Chaotic Spirit.

The First Beings of Aura were now in balance, and saw the goodness and love of Cret, so they chose to stay in balance. This marked a short lived period of time where Cret was fully content with his creation, known as the [[Age of Unity]]. 

#### The Great Battle for Aura

Rem and Slán can generally understand Cret’s belief system and therefore have a base level of respect for him and his creation. Despite this, the two opposing Eternals will inevitably clash, as they did in the [[Great Battle for Aura]]. This war was an extension of the [[Endless Astral Conflict]] that took place between beings on Aura, peaking on Cret’s continent of Cretovia, leading to destruction across its lands. Cretovia, Cret’s pride, joy, and source of purpose was now a war zone. 

Rem’s forces from Reltrome and Aliyata from Dysfunction started their siege in [[Dormiaán]], and Slán’s forces from Flyígan and Aliyata from Perfection landed in [[Nebulzia]]. [[Lunelvín]] and Artembia were untouched in this conflict. 

The Cretovians were taken by surprise and slaughtered because they had no way to defend themselves due to a thus far peaceful existence. 

Cret, appalled by the destruction, wanted to save his creations from the other Eternals. He made Aura bigger, filling it with vast oceans and magical barriers so that the other Eternal’s beings could never reach [[Cretovia]], [[Lunelvín]] or [[Artembia]] again. 

### The Age of Consequence (AC)

The conclusion of the Great Battle for Aura ended the Age of Unity, and began [[Age of Consequence]].

Where the threat from another invasion of Cretovia was diminished, the [[Great Battle for Aura]] destroyed the Cretovians’ way of life and had lasting effects. The Cretovian races had now experienced the destruction and slaughter of their peoples, and began to mimic it. They fed into their chaotic and orderly spirits, becoming unbalanced. By doing this, they were increasing Rem and Slán’s grip on Cret's creation. They did many immoral and destructive things, like split into factions, worshiped Aliyata as Gods, races discriminated against one another, and they started wars. During this Age, other races evolved from the First Beings, known as [[The Descendants of Aura]].

Cret, frustrated with his people’s destructive nature, sought to limit their free will through natural means, succumbing to the inevitable - where there is Creation, there will always be Destruction. 

#### The [[Wrath of Cret]]

In his wrath, Cret made many hostile barriers to divide his lands further. In [[Cretovia]], he created the [[Endless Storm of Cretovia]] between Eyuda and Dormiaán, and put the active volcano [[Mt. Ziqead]], along with the [[Aberrant Fissures]] between Eyuda and Nebulzia. He made the oceans even more of an extremely hostile and unnavigable place, so the three regions became separate lands, and were virtually cut off from one another. 

In addition to these physical divisions, Cret created the [[Balmun]]; large beasts that roamed the lands, forcing all of the factions to decentralize and the Descendants to drop lower in the food chain. The Descendants were no longer the apex predators of Aura. All of these changes used up [[Astral Energy]]. 

Finally, Cret used a majority of The Hither’s remaining [[Astral Energy]] to manifest a strong barrier between Aura and The Hither, to stop Rem and Slan from interfering. This limited all of the Eternal’s direct control of their [[Eternal Spirits]] on Aura, and in turn their influence on their creations. Despite this, the Eternal Spirits will forever be alive in all they had assisted in creating, always influencing the beings of Aura. 

After [[The Barrier]] was established, the only way the Eternals could communicate to the beings directly is through their [[Aliyata]], using [[Manifestation]] to turn their spiritual forms into [[Matter]], (which requires [[Astral Energy]], most of which is utilized by Aura and The Barrier). 

#### The Divided Age (DA)

After The Barrier, thus began [[The Divided Age]]. This Age is the only age documented by the people of Cretovia, lasting about 20,000 years till present day.

Within this time period, vast kingdoms crumbled, races evolved, and technology slowly but surely increased to provide ways to survive in the new hostile world. 

Within this time period certain geographic changes occurred that shaped Cretovia forever. 

The storm was an effective barrier between Eyuda and Dormiaán, and coupled with the [[Deadly Mountains]], proved to be impenetrable. But to the west, the volcano and fissures desolated Nebulzia. The Nebulzia peoples were 99% wiped out. Over the next millennia, as the volcanic activity calmed down, those who were left in Nebulzia mustered together and settled down. Their skin mutated to acquire scales to protect against the heat, and they became known as the [[Nebulzian]] race. 

In Dormiaán, the mountains allowed for vast rivers to flow and forests to prosper. Dormiaán developed widespread cultures quickly. 

Eyuda, the original promised land of Cretovia, grew to field the most race diversity, despite being the smallest region.

Knowledge of each other in the Divided Age:

Over time all three parts of Cretovia know they exist, but so much time has passed (hundreds of thousands of years) with little contact, that they have evolved differently, and have drastically different cultures and societies. There has been no known contact between Dormiaán and the other regions, and there has been little contact between the Nebulzians (are mostly pirates or desert nomadic) and the Eyudans. 

The [[Cretovian Chronicles]] take place in Eyuda  the Modern Era (MA:203). The volcanic activity of [[Mt. Ziqead]] halted abruptly in 198, which allowed the Aberrant Fissures to be passable on foot for the past 5 years. Some Krilstuthians had crossed into the deserts and brought back tales of Nebulzian ships and pirates, kings and tribes, Mreikenite wanderers, and desert beasts similar to the [[Balmun]] that plague the Eyudan peoples. 

The [[Endless Storm of Cretovia]] still thunders on over the [[Deadly Mountains]] and — ocean
