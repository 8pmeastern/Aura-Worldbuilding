All three accounts of the Divided Age are different in three  subcontinents of Cretovia.

### Nebulzia

Nebulzia never kept track of time... they don't have a rich history nor did they feel the need to keep track of anything. They were focused on adaptation and survival for most of the divided age. That beign said, there are few literary pieces detailing the kings of the Nebulzian past.


### Dormiaan

Dormiaan has a clearly documeted past, split into two distinct eras... the Pre Bolvianic Era and the Bolvianic Era. The Bolvian is a device created by the Cretons of Dormiaan that can harness astral energy into one source, to be used to power large creations, tame wild beasts, and destroy armies. The Bolvian is powered by feeding it with any matter, breaking it into its spiritual and Astral components, and then storing the Astral Energy. This Astral energy can then be manifested into weapons, etc. The Cretons used The Bolvian to reign tyrannous over Dormiaan, persecuting the other races and almost genociding them to fuel the Bolvian.

### Eyuda
All Eyudan sources of history in the Divided Age are located in the Library of Dunbolini in Traczilia.

History in the divided age is split into 5 Eras

**The Fractious Era**
*FE 0-1467*
Trying to survive in new world, very decentralized. Few writings from this time survive.

The [[Balmun]] come down from the mountains, rise from the seas, and descend from the clouds. 

**The Razulic Era** 
*RE 0-471*
Razul the Krilstuthian sought to unite all towns to trade and help establish cities, build walls, etc; Tractzilla became the Center of Trade for Eyuda, and the capital of the Krilstuthian Kingdom. Other cities began to increase in size such as [[Mountain Top]], established by [[Cemork the Great]], [[Greymul]], [[Teymok]], and [[Qig]]. The Razulic era saw the major races of Euyda Establish their presence and build their culture. 

##### **The Empirical Era** 
*EE 0-1094*

Qigiun Empire 
A Qigiu known as Wembus Trombu conquered all kingdoms and established the [[Qigiu Empire]] to show that the Qigiu are superior and spread the worship of the Qigiu Pantheon, which includes famous perennials from all three Eternals. This shaped the religious followings of the Euydans. 

It was during the reign of the Qigiun Empire when The Sludge first appeared and began to wreak havoc on the eastern jungle lands in Dormiaan.

The Cracked Dawn
*EE 439- 761*

An uprising of Racism towards The Drenoculans and "Sunderlings"; Qigiu and humans wanted to force them back into the Sunder. The Qigiu didn't like how the Drenoculans were worshiping other gods, and humans didn't like how drenoculans were living on their land. This lead to a civil war between the Qigiu and Humans vs the Krilstuthians and Drenoculans, dividing the empire. Drenocs were pushed into the Sunder or sought refuge with the Krils, but the empire was at a stalemate, and shattered the Qigiu Empire. The Traczillian Krils didnâ€™t want to support the Drenocs, but Krils from the northern Heighblin Plains did. After the Quigi Empire was broken, the Tractzillian Krils revolted on their own and created the Traczillian Technocracy, and the Krils of Teymok created the Democratic Commune of Hieghblin. 

The Cryploc Plague & Tsunamis of the Eternals
*EE 761 - 773*

A series of Tsunamis, known by the Eyudans as the Tsunamis of the Eternals, flooded the Qigiu home land and almost wiped out the race. Qigiu can only reproduce through mitosis, and this can only be done in their home land where the Rinly plant grows, so many children were killed. Cryploc Disease also rampaged through Eyuda, killing off 2/3 of the humans and Krilstuthians. Those of the Sunder were safe from the disease, as sunlight caused it to spread. Denoculans often believe this was the result of them praying to their gods to enact revenge on the humans. 

The Swift Reckoning 
(The Invasion of the Zang-slo)
*EE 773 - 786*

The Savage Zang-slo were said to have lived in the depths of the Sunder for thousands of years, below that of the Dronocs and Sunderlings, waiting for their chance to strike. When they finally made their assault, they took over the Sunder, pushing most of the Drenocs out of their homes and into the wilderness, particularly the Ancient Forest. Stiffies come from these drenocs who bred with the beasts and trees. The Zang-slo saw the wealth of Eyuda and wanted it for themselves, so they subjugated most of the peoples of Eyuda to slavery, although they never were able to conquer Tractzilia, which remained closed off the rest of Eyuda for most of the war. 

The Zang-Slo were not men of Energy, although they had mages in their ranks. They never tried to tame the Balmun, and any attempts at killing them were unsuccessful. Yet they managed to push them into hiding for the next three centuries. 

EE 786 - 1094

Zang-Slo & The War for Eyuda
Life under the Zang slo was terrible. The Zang-Slo would terrorize communities, ensalve people to work, and were obsessed with conquering the world. We know not their motivations other than power and wealth. It was told that many Eyudans would be shipped off to fight in wars in distant Cretovian lands that were deemed inaccessible dude to the [[Endless Storm of Cretovia]] and [[Mt. Ziqead]]. Although there had been many rebellions over the reign of the Zang-Slo, the rebellion that started in DA:EE 1088 would bring the Zang-Slo Regime to its end. This became known as The War for Eyuda, where the [[Hammers of Vengeance]], a team of heros from across Eyuda, began to harness the power of Astral Energy to fight against the Zang-slo and were able to mount a large assault and pushed them back into the Sunder. [[The Drenoculan Order]] was established, and placed in charge of making sure they stay there. The win against the [[Zang-Slo]] increased the relations between most of the kingdoms and races of Eyuda, and started the Modern Era. 

The Modern Era 
*ME 0-present* 

The [[Balmun]] began to resurface after the Zang-Slo were defeated. This has mixed feelings for the peoples of Eyuda. Harnessing astral energy proved to be an effective way to combat and tame beasts as well, and we see an increase of beast taming. 

13 Kingdoms rise and gain wealth, power, population, identity and independence. 

*ME:303* Tension is stirring, and Euyda is on the brink of a large war for the first time in nearly 300 years (since the end of the Empirical Era).
