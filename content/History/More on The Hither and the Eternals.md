### What is The Hither?

The Hither is the 4th dimension constructed by two fundamental sources: spirit and energy. All of spirit is part of one of the three ever-conscious beings known as the Eternals, and these three Eternals make up all of the spirit, in varying degrees at varying times. “The Hither” is coined by the beings of “Aura”, the 3rd dimension. 

To preface, it is easier to think of Aura located within The Hither, not necessarily a separate place. 

In Aura, physics work the same as on earth. Matter cannot (seemingly) be created or destroyed, objects are attracted to each other due to gravity, time is constant, and other laws of physics are naturally obeyed. 

In The Hither, matter is easily created and destroyed by the Eternals, because matter IS spirit, and spirit IS the Eternals. In 4D, spirit cannot be created or destroyed, but can be “manifested” by beings through the  utilization of energy. All spirit is always connected, and is what makes up every being. If it’s conscious, it’s known as a “being.” 

### The Hither is Not a Place… although it consists of places

The Hither is not really a “place” that you can go to. It is purely spirit. That spirit can be manifested to create beings, objects, and places, that any being can become aware of, using senses (sight, touch, intuition, etc). If these beings, objects, and places transcend matter and time, they are in the 4th dimension. If these beings and objects use matter and the fundamental laws that come with it, they are in the 3rd dimension, Aura. 

### Time in The Hither

There is no “time” in The Hither, at least relative to our time. Time in The Hither is a progression, that to The Three Eternals, can be sped up, reversed, stopped, and altered.

### The Three Eternals: Source of All

The Three Eternals are known as Cret, Eternal Creation; Rem, Eternal Chaos; and Slán, Eternal Order. 

The Eternals are beings, but not represented as one physical being. They stretch themselves across all spirit, and all other beings. Together the Eternals are The Hither, and make up everything… all spirit, and in turn, all matter. They always were, and always will be. The Eternals cannot perish and are ever present, as their consciousnesses are tied directly to The Hither, to one another and to all spirit.

### Energy and Spirit

In The Hither, there are two eternal sources: Spirit and Energy. Spirit is the medium in which all consciousness exists (including the Eternals. Energy flows through spirit, and can be utilized by all beings (to varying degrees) using “manifestation”. Manifestation is how The Eternals utilize energy to form spirit into other beings, objects and places, and how they constructed Aura out of matter. Spirit and energy are finite, but in a closed system. They are never taken away or added to the Hither, just eternally redistributed. Energy and spirit is often fought over by the Eternals, as they can only possess so much at one time. 

### The link between Energy, Spirit and Matter (manifestation and dissipation)

Energy and spirit link directly to 3D Aura in the form of matter. Matter is a manifestation of spirit that behaves in a unique way, following certain laws that limit its ability to utilize spirit. Energy flows from spirit, into Aura through matter, and back to spirit when the matter dissipates. 

Aura is surrounded by nothingness, known as the void. When matter enters the void, it is essentially “destroyed” from the 3D world in a process known as “dissipation.” As mentioned above, manifestation is spirit being transformed into beings, objects, places and matter. Dissipation is matter returning back into spirit, its natural form. In both of these processes, energy is used. 

Focused and utilized energy is the glue that keeps consciousnesses active and “thinking”, it’s what keeps matter in tact and able to be pulled apart, and keeps spirit eternal and ever present.

### What happens when someone in Aura dies?

When someone dies in Aura, their consciousness enters “the void” and dissipates from matter to spirit using energy. But, their being is still in tact, known as a Spirit (proper noun, capital S) to the Auraians. A Spirit is simply a 4D being that was at one point manifested into a being made of matter in the 3D. 

A Spirit can be dissipated further into its pure spirit and cease to exist, but its footprint will be etched into the winds of the Hither for eternity. Any being that once was, can be called upon again by another being powerful and skilled enough, and given back its senses (utilizing energy). Any 4D being can spend eternity as a spirit in The Hither, or can be remanifested into another being in Aura. 

When a being, object, or place has been dissolved to its purest form, the spirit left over is known as Pure Spirit, in a process is known as Purification. A being in pure spirit cannot remanifest itself, but the the “DNA” (for lack of better term) and memories of this being are still there.  

### Can an Eternal be Destroyed, or Dissipated? - A Deeper Look Into Spirit

Theoretically, an eternal could be dissipated, but never destroyed. 

First let’s look at destruction. An eternal could never be destroyed because spirit is never destroyed.

Destruction is undoing creation. Spirit and energy were never created, therefore they can never be destroyed. Matter was created, and therefore can be destroyed. 

##### There are four types of spirit: 

- Creation Spirit
- Chaotic Spirit
- Orderly Spirit
- Pure Spirit  

Pure spirit can be directly manipulated by all other spirits, and contained the consciousness of all Three Eternals simultaneously. This spirit is short lived as energy is attracted to it and it immediately is manifested by the Eternals. Into the other three spirits.  

Spirit is never destroyed, just altered to be apart of one, or all three of the Eternals. 

Before we look into dissipation, let’s look at two fundamental properties of energy. 

1. Energy is attracted to the type of spirit that is least common across The Hither. 
2. It takes energy for the Eternals to dissolve spirit  

Theoretically, if two Eternals dissolved all spirit of the third, then the third eternal’s consciousness would only exist in Pure Spirit. And if that Pure Spirit was claimed by the other Eternals, the lone Eternal’s consciousness would be dissolved. This could never happen though, due to energy being attracted to the eternal with less spirit. When an Eternal’s spirit is low, their energy is greater and therefore their capacity to convert pure spirit is higher. So mathematically there is a point where an Eternal’s Spirit could be so low, that any more of their spirit dissolved would be immediately converted back to their own spirit due to the energy possessed by that Eternal. 

##### Something that has less energy can’t dissipate something that has more energy. 

See Eternals are at odds for spirit. Spirit is controlled by the eternal through manifestation, and each of the three have their reasons for manifesting. It is said that in the “beginning” all spirit was pure, and in the “end” when the Eternals find harmony, all spirit will be pure again. 

Very rarely are beings made of 100% of the same Eternal spirit. Perennials are 99% a single Eternal, minions and followers are further, and the beings of Aura are all different levels of Eternal Spirits. Certain races have affinities to be made of more chaotic spirit and vice versa, but it all depends on the individual. 

### What are The Three Eternals like?

The Three transcend time and space, will always be conscious, and always were. Therefore, they cannot feel emotion in the way that we do. They must create barriers within their world to feel things through the matter they embody.

The Eternals also fundamentally disagree on their own purpose of being, which leads to principles that govern the way they manifest. They are constantly at odds with each other due to this. 

### Cret

Cret believes spirit is precious and the fact the Eternals exist is a blessing. He believes the Eternals should use the energy to create extraordinary things and preserve these creations, because it is the closest the Eternals will ever get to emotion, change, and in Cret’s mind - purpose. He values the beings who preserve, create and seek knowledge. He values uniqueness. He is also very scientific and creates things to understand why they behave certain ways. If Cret had his way, all energy and Spirit would be used to create unique beings who live life to the fullest. He understands the importance of himself, Slán and Rem, and how crucial they are to his purpose, so he is grateful. Honestly, Cret already has his way, and is grateful for it. 

Gods created by Cret are generally helpful to Auraians who seek knowledge, who want to solve dilemmas by way of peacekeeping, and who seek some sort of balance of life, whether on a grand scale or a personal scale. 

Cret created Aura and the first 3D beings to have Free Will. This means they are able to choose their own principles and way of life. He did this because, again, he believes it is his purpose to create and understand.  

To other beings, Cret is the pulling of one’s inner self towards creation, towards balance, towards understanding and curiosity, towards knowledge, towards sticking to what you believe is right regardless of what others think, towards peace and contentment, towards change and gratitude. Cret is the natural tendency toward individuality, and to experience life in its fullest, and appreciate it, no matter its rewards or tribulations. 

### Slán

Slán believes the Eternals should find a way to structure what they have. She is less concerned with creation and more concerned with ordering creation. In a lot of ways, she believes she is picking up after Cret’s mess. Everything to Slán is a mess, and out of order. There is only one way things should be, and if they are not that way (they rarely are), it eternally pisses the Eternal off. If Slán had her way with Aura, every atom would be ordered, every object labeled and standardized, every being fully agreeing with one another. If Cret and (ESPECIALLY) Rem were nonexistent… Aura wouldn’t be a thing, and all spirit and energy would be aligned perfectly forever, as it should be. 

Gods created by Slán generally want to solve specific issues by way of order, and are often very present in Aura. They heavily influence kings to rule over all land and structure their kingdoms in certain ways. They are often times the reason a faction is started, to unite people under common values. All those who seek order know: “To enact order, power must be achieved.” Most of the Gods of Slán flock to power hungry individuals.

To other beings, Slán is the natural tendency towards order, structure, and control. Slán is the pulling of one’s inner self toward conformity, standardization, and stability, often through use of power, which can be achieved using mischievous tactics. 

### Rem  

Rem believes the Eternals existence is a joke. He believes that Cret and Slán are silly for trying to make a purpose out of spirit, and it should be used merely for amusement. He has a deep rooted motivation towards chaos and disorder. If he does have a purpose it is to return things into a chaotic order. He directly opposes Slán in most ways, and Cret he at least understands to a reasonable extent. If Rem had his way with Aura he would let moral codes be broken, anarchy reign, empires rise for the soul purpose of leading them toward destruction. If Cret and Slán were non existent, Aura would most likely be created and destroyed many times over for Rems amusement.  

As for Gods created by Rem, they vary tremendously. Some of his spirit is manifested in Gods with destructive tendencies. Other beings are those who exist purely to exist. Other times, they just love to have a good laugh and value the unexpected. These Gods love to support chaos in other peoples lives… this is not necessarily a “bad” thing. Some Chaos Perennials help Auraians who want to revolt against evil kings and disobey the status quo. 

To other beings, Rem is the urge to rebel. Rem is the natural tendency towards disorder, destruction, and separation. Rem is the inner pull to be different, to go against the status quo, to be unexpected, careless and carefree. 

### A note on “good” and “evil”

At first glance one may say “Rem is evil, Cret is good and Slán is maybe…neutral?”

My question to you is, on what basis? In The Hither, good and evil are subjective to the beholder. We as readers can have our own opinions, but in the Hither, all three forces work together like Ying Yang and Yodle. If any Eternal manifests too much spirit, it would have “bad” results for all three of them. Therefore there is a constant push and pull that balances out between the three forces of creation, chaos and order, and this is reflected in all of creation and by the the properties of energy. 

### What is the opposite of creation?

It’s easy to see how chaos and order are opposed, but what about creation? 

Inherently, the embodiment of both chaos AND order would be the direct opposite of creation: destruction. Slán and Rem both lean towards destruction in different ways. Rem is very flux with it, as he may embody destruction today, maybe creation tomorrow, it doesn’t matter to him, as long as it’s unexpected and never consistent. Slán will always embody destruction if the creation doesn’t fit perfectly into order as she expected it to. 

Generally in our world we think in duality. Good vs evil. Right vs wrong. We have to shift our way of thinking in this world, because none of The Three are 100% wrong or right. But nonetheless, translating this to our world and way of duality, Cret embodies real world natural moral goodness, and the opposite of what Cret desires (pure chaos + order; “ordered chaos”) embodies real world natural moral evil. 

### How are 4D beings created?

The Three can use energy to manipulate spirit into other beings. Every spiritual consciousness is considered a “being”. These beings have various degrees of freedom. All 4D, spiritual based beings transcend matter, and can manipulate it to varying degrees. Most 4D beings can manipulate spirit, but only what they are allowed to by the laws the Eternals grated them. Immortal 4D beings created directly by the Eternals are called Perennials. They can technically be destroyed, but they are direct 4D embodiments of the Eternals, so they will most likely be remanifested and given back their memories. 4D beings can utilize energy to create their own 4D beings. These beings are mostly known as minions or followers, and often take 3D forms to perform various tasks throughout Aura to serve their Perennials. They have lesser abilities to utilize energy for spirit manipulation, and often can manipulate matter. 

To the 3D beings of Aura, 4D beings appear to be able to do magical things, which is really the being utilizing energy to manipulate matter and spirit in certain ways. 

##### Cool things they can do:

- Teleport
- Telekinesis 
- Fly
- Possess bodies 
- Raise bodies from the dead
- Create things out of thin air
- Morph matter into objects

### Another way to comprehend everything on this page:

Think of The Hither as a sphere. This sphere is filled with two components water and salt. Let’s say that water is energy, and salt is spirit. These always exist within each other, especially when they are dissolved. Both of these components are finite in the sphere. There’s only so much water and salt to go around.

Let’s assume there is a button. This button instantly separates salt from the water, creating a little salt Rock. In order to do this, a little bit of salt is taken from the water, leaving less salt dissolved in the water. Also, water (energy) was utilized at that time to create the salt rock (matter). Over time, the salt rock starts to decay, and dissolve back into the water. This ALSO utilizes water (energy). 

Assume there are only 3 people who have full and equal control over what the water does and what the salt does… these are The Eternals.
  

The Three ARE the water, and they have equal control over all of the water. You can think of each as a different “color”. Using this color analogy, the water starts out as “white”. If Rem creates something, that salt structure is more red than blue and yellow, and therefore Rem has more control over it. If Slán creates something, the being/structure is more blue than red and yellow, and therefore Slán has more control over it.

I’m sure you can see where this creates a three way tug of war between the Three Gods.

The Eternals can create beings because they focus energy to manipulate spirit (themselves) into things. Why? They each have their own reasons listed above.
