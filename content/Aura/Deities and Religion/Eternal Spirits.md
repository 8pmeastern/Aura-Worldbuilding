Each of [[The Three Eternals]] claims a relative spirit called an Eternal Spirit that is used in the creation of anything. These spirits are held together by [[Astral Energy]], and are claimed by one of the three Eternals. When separated from Astral Energy entirely, it is known as [[Pure Spirit]]. Pure Spirit contains all Three Eternals and neither of the Three Eternals at once.
