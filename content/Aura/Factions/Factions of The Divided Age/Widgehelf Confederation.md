A feudalist State, split into many sovereign territories with their own rules and laws. All are bound by a universal treaty called the Widghelf Pact to allow free trade, militia support in times of need and free travel. Most races are welcome here and not discriminated against, although the city of Widghelf is crime ridden and sectioned into ethic areas.Â 

Widghelf consists of 12 provinces, mostly located in and around the Blackridge Mountains.
