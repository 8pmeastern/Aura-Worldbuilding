- Bodies live 60 years but have ties to the Dark Angel and therefore their spirits can be preserved and placed in a new body. Humans, Krils, Drenocs, Nebs, Braids, Stiffies, Gorskats, are captured, and their bodies are sacrificed to the Dark Angel who places a Stocainian spirt inside them, which morphs their body into a newly created Stocainian body
- Stocainians cannot breed so they need more creative ways to keep their race alive… like in the story people will think they don’t exist but really they have been breeding the other races for thousands of years to create a Stocainian army

- Morally evil, evil rooted
