- Smaller hairless horse with lizard tongue and sharp teeth
- Domesticated by underdwellers, krilstuthians
- Can run fast and climb up walls/rocks using clawed feet that look like hooves when galloping, but open up into claws that grab onto walls and can penetrate stone. 
- Comes from nebulzia, Krils bred them to form their army because they donâ€™t like hairy creatures (horses)
