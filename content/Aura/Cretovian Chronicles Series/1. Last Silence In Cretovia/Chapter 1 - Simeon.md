([[Simeon Nemil]])

The sun shone bright over the Nemil farm, and the absence of snow clouds brought Simeon great peace. The farm boy smiled at the clear skies, as he knew this was a good sign for the throp harvest to come. He used his overcoat to clear the sweat and melting snow from his forehead and paused to look at the work he had done. It was the first day of harvesting, and it had been a good one! Him and his father’s 30 men cleared roughly 1/10th of the seemingly endless farm land. 

His attention then went to the tool in his hands. He flipped it upside down, wiping off the frigid dirt and plant matter from a hard day’s work. The water from his warm breath on the sickle began to create patterns of ice before he rubbed the tool clean, revealing his satisfied face. He noticed his white-blue eyes, those that his mother used to say rivaled that of the Cryog peaks to the north. A few straggling strands of brown hair hung lower than normal, past his eyes and tickling his cheekbones. The rest of his long hair was covered under his favorite ushanka. It was a gift from his mom, who bought it for him when he was four, off of a [[Lömin]] traveling with a trade caravan. The stone man told them that he made it from a [[Cazpí]] he skinned himself while traveling through [[The Barren]]. That was the first and last time he ever saw a stone- 
“Pick up the pace Sim, we got 2 hours till dusk!” - his wandering imagination came to a halt. 
The sense of urgency in his father’s voice insinuated Simeon’s satisfaction in the work they had accomplished was misplaced.

As he got back to work, the boy began to imagine how interesting it must have been to see throp growing for the first time. 

[[Snow Throp]], you see, is the hardiest of plants in Eyuda. Growing wild in the snowy domain of the [[The Tundra]] , throp was cultivated by the earliest settlers of Mountain Top centuries ago, when Cemork the Great claimed this land for his people. It’s unique property to grow through *at least* a foot and a half of snow in below freezing temperatures flabbergasted the Great King. He loved the taste so much, that he ordered it to be the sole plant grown by Cemorkan farmers. 

And so Simeon's great great great great grandfather Ned Nemil, planted his first seed at the heart of the peaks. This is where Cemork decided to found [[Mountain Top]]. Fast forward some years, and The Nemil Farm is the largest supplier of food to the Eyudan kingdoms! (well, with the exception of the Grand Corn Fields in the Plains… and the communal rice fields in the Dirt…. so maybe not the largest, but who’s counting, thought Simeon). 

Regardless, the work being done here is so vital to the economy of Eyuda, especially the Cemork kingdom, that Simeon is motivated enough to continue slicing away. 

The funny thing is, Simeon doesn’t care much for the taste of Throp. He would much rather a nice rice cake or some pork and beans than the strong bitter taste of Throp. 




Simeon and the Great King would have to disagree.

“By Cret! Jimbo, as necessary as it is to the Peaks, snow throp will always smell like shit!”

Jimbo made a disgusted look. 

It is true that snow throp has a very *distinct* smell. One may even say *grotesque*, if not aware that any notion against snow throp within the Peaks could get you thrown behind bars.
