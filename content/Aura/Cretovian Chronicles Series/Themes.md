The importance of unity against a common threat. 

Evil will be evil, good will be good, but there are lots of moral grey areas. There is an objective moral code, as laid by Cret. Creation is generally good and destruction is generally evil, (but sometimes destruction is required to bring about life, and creation can lead to unethical decisions. 
- Most of the races curse Cret for dividing them, but it’s solely a perspective thing. That’s what Simeon seeks to capture and tame the [[Balmun]], to show that every ounce of creation is worth saving. 

Creation allows order and chaos to exist at equilibrium. 

Wonder at a unique and hyper beautiful world

Cret laid the moral code and gave [[The First Beings of Aura]] purpose through [[Free Will]] and [[Reason]] by mixing all three eternal spirits to create them. What is morally just and unjust comes from Cret alone, even is specific societies have their own subjective codes. 

Not a theme, but I want to stress things are NOT inevitable. Free will can change things. Oracles are stupid.
