A civil war breaks out between the POOC fighting with the forces of order, and the Zang-Slo fighting with the forces of chaos.

Meanwhile our hero’s are still fighting the good fight for their homeland against all the invasive forces. 

Aurora gives Simeon a task that he must travel for the three pillars, the Pillar of chaos located between Cretovia and [[Reltrome]], the Pillar of Order, located between Cretovia and [[Flyígan]], and the Pillar of Creation located between Cretovia and [[Lunelvín]]. At each Pillar he finds an Eternal Heart that only he can wield. When he does this, the barriers between the islands will be broken, and any creatures may travel between the islands once more (although they are still very far apart). He is then to throw all of the Hearts down the Astral Pit under the Hover, which will destroy the Barrier. The reason for this is so Cret would be able to come and save them. 

Simeon begins his quest with Jessandra and …. Taking 3 flying Balmun (make sure they are not same species).
