After nearly crushing the forces of Chaos, Sláns forces of Order begin to fully enslave everyone. If someone acts out they kill them. They force them to do stupid work that means nothing (to keep them busy until death). The Death King is technically the king over all peoples, but he begins to notice he has no power because the forces of Order are in control now. He is a slave to order as well. 

He wrestles with his emotions throughout the book at the world he has created. At the end of the book he meets Simeon at the Hover with the Eternal Hearts and somehow ends up with them.

“Are you going to stop me, Death King?” - Simeon Nemil

“No. I started my reign with Chaos and now I will end it with Chaos!” - The Death King

He then sacrifices himself by jumping into the Astral Pit under the Hover and disappearing into the void. All three Eternal Hearts combine and explode, destroying the Hover and shattering the barrier. Slán and Rem have now fully unleashed their power and all Astral energy has been released back into the universe.
