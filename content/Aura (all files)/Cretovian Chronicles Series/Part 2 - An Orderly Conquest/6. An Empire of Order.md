When The Death King has a hard time keeping Eyuda in order, he is reminded that he used agents of Chaos to take what was his. He enlists Slán’s perennials to help with this issue, but they prove more troublesome then help. 

At the end of the book, the Zang slo turn on the death king because they were promised Eyuda (but it was taken away from them due to their inability to keep order). This results in a civil war between the POOC and slans forces (trying to keep order) on one side, and on the other, the Zang-slo are joined by Rems forces (due to their chaotic nature and love for it).
