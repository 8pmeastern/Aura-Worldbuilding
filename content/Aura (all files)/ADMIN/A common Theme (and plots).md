An important theme I want to ingrain into Aura worldbuilding and storytelling:

***Destruction is necessary for Creation to thrive.*** 

People across Cretovia often hold the Eternals/gods as a moral axium, but only Cret determines moral goodness because he is the creator of all things. 

Cret created the first Cretovians with an inert moral code and wrote this into the land itself, so most creatures on Aura have a general understanding. This was achieved because Cretovians were created with part chaotic spirt, part orderly spirt, and part creative spirit. 

The Eternals create a type of Ying-Yang-Yong relationship.

I want this theme to play out in the creation story, and throughout the books.
