This western-human based oligopoly was run by three brothers. After one brother murders the other and scapegoats the third, the murderer assumes full control, and runs tyranny. He takes over the entire western Cretovia, and wants to take over Eastern Cretovia. In order to get there he has to sail across the oceans, but cannot because technology isn’t advanced enough and the ocean is too infested with sea monsters. Obsessed with full control of the world, he’s decided to use dark magic to destroy the forever storm and cross the endless mountains.
