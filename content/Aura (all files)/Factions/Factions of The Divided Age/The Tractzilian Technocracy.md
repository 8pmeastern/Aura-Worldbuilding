The Tractzilian Krils lay claim to their area in the southeastern corner of Eastern Cretovia. 

The Tractzilian Krils pride themselves in technological advancement and sorcery. Growing their society so close to the Volcano, they were forced to come up with extreme measures to be able to survive. 

  

Their government (technocracy) is a direct reflection of these attributes. They have 5 High Council members who have different requirements. Each council member has their “tribe” which signifies the job field that its members hold in society. Tractzilian men and women are selected at a young age to be a part of one of these 5 tribes. If you are not in a tribe you are often denounced and viewed as in unproductive member of Tractzilian Society. Tractzilians are 80% Krilstuthian, but some Tribe members are other races. Other races live primarily in towns on the outskirts of Tractzilia. 

  

The 5 Tribes are

- The Construction Tribe

- This tribe plans, constructs, and maintains buildings and roads all around Tractzilia. They are responsible for the unique architecture of the Technocracy, including their Irrigation system, grand walls, catapults, marble roads, ships, tunnels, and layered apartment-like housing of the capital city of Wreyzmal

- The Protectors Tribe

- This tribe is responsible for the defensive and offensive operations within and around Traczilia. They have a rich history of aiding in the growth and protection of the Tractzilian borders, and are known to be aggressive towards outsiders. They get paid to protect certain cities who do not directly fall under Tractzilian jurisdiction. 

- The Farming Tribe

- The farming tribe is in charge of making sure the Tractzilian people are fed. This is mostly challenging due to farm land being so scarce in the southern regions due to the aberrant fissures, but the irrigation system has brought tremendous growth to kingdom in the late Divided Age. 

- The Cultural Tribe

- This tribe is tasked with keeping the cultural society of Traczilia in tact, and the general populace happy and educated. Traczilia has a rich culture and history that shines in their everyday life. 

- The Economic Tribe 

- This tribe has a focus on making sure the Tractzilain people have all the items they need. Tractzilian currency is accepted in most of Eastern Cretovia, and traders must work together to keep the society afloat and provide value not only to each other, but also to foreigners. 

All tribes are bound by a constitution outlining their governmental structure and constitutional law. 

  

Those not apart of a tribe do not have a representation in the High Council. They can still live within the Traczilian society, but they have minimal benefits and are looked down upon. Foreigners are common, but not necessarily welcome. 

  

In the Late Divided Age, the Council is facing serval issues:

  

With the dwindling of the Aberrant Fissures and slowing of Mt. Ziqead, many are concerned for the safety of the empire in relation to Nebulzia

  

Nebulzian Pirates are common, as they have found ways to navigate the Coastal Seas and occasionally raid coastal cities in Tractzilian territory. With the passageway to Nebulzia being more accessible, the High Council is concerned of land raids, especially to crop land, and some are cautious of invasion. 

  

Another issue is the humans… the Dimonae empire is increasingly aggressive and hostile towards Krils, and talk of a possible conflict has been brewing. 

  

The Technocracy is split into 4 regions
