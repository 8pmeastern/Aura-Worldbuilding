Cemork Kingdom

  

This human-run land is full of Humans, Braidwolves, and Drenoculans to the south.  

Cemork has a rich history of being Mountain Men, those who can weather the cold and mine for gold and silver. These humans adapted to this life style over thousands of years. 

  

The origin of the Cemork Kingdom starts with Cemork Fellenbrow.

As the story goes, Télonia, the great city and capital of Eastern Cretovia during the Age of Consequence. When the divided age began, Eastern Cretovia went into turmoil. The people to the east began to look toward the pains and the swamp land, and the people of the west began to look to the forests and the mountains. This caused a larger divide and eventually led to two different races, the Humans and the Krilstuthians. 

  

Cemork, who would later be known as Cemork the Great, sought to unite the Western lands from his home town of Mountain Top. He was declared king of the new monarchy after he united the north eastern lands under a fair and just constitutional monarchy. He ruled with great success and benevolence.
