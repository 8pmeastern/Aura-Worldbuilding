A sub race of Humans that live longer, are taller, and are skilled with weaponry. It Is believed they are the purist form of humans from the Age of Unity, but there are so few of them left in Eyuda. Most all who know of the Pelitat have a high respect for them. 

They are called Pelitats because of the ancient city of [[Pelatia]], where the humans are believed to have had their capital in Eyuda. 

Most have a high sense of independence, morality and loyalty to whomever they serve.
