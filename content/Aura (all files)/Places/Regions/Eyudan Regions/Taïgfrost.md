A cold Taiga in Eyuda, high in altitude and filled with boreal forests and alpine meadows. Sometimes called the Taig, this region stretches from [[Mountain Top]] in the east, White Falls in the North, [[The Living Loch]] to the west, and the Wild Wood to the south. 

At the heart of the Taïgfrost is the Frigewood, a huge Boreal forest that spans the length of [[Kolgör’s Bane]]. Located north of the river, this forest is rarely traversed. The Everbloom Road that leads through the town of Pinewood is the only path in and out of the forest. 


**Borders**
[[The Wild]] and the [[The Living Loch]] to the south, the [[Deadly Mountains]] to the West, [[The Blackridge Mountains]] and the [[Ancient Woodland]] to the East, and [[The Dirt]] to the north.

[[Kolgör’s Bane]]
The icy river that divides the Taig into two. Named after the [[Balmun]] [[Kolgör]], this river has rapid currents and is filled with ice chunks. Flowing from the [[Cryog Peaks]] that surround [[Mountain Top]], hug pieces of ice make their way down the mountain east, all the way to [[The Living Loch]]. This is one of the major rivers in Eyuda. 

Geographically, the region is split into 3 “Rifts”, the Alpines, the Frigewood and the White Fall Plateaus. 

**Political Environment**
Home to the [[Cemork Kingdom]], who at one point controlled the entire [[Taïgfrost]] and [[The Tundra]]. Historically, the Cemork Kingdom would provide food and protection for the Taigfrost towns, and therefore win allegiance of the various communities. Recently, a number of towns have decided to cede from the kingdom’s protection, in part due to the influence of the Widghelf Confederations unique approach to decentralization, and in part due to the Taïg’s waning confidence in the Kingdom to manage international politics with the other Eyudan nations.
