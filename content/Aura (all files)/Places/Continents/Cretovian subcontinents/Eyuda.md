Region setting of the 5 Kingdoms in the Cretovian Chronicles.

Eyuda is a vast land of monsters and magic, cities and kingdoms, wilds and seas. 

There are freezing lands to the south west, deserts and volcanos to the south east. Underground societies that stretch for miles into Aura's crust. Great oceans full of hostile creatures, and distant lands that have never been touched by any Eyudan. The [[Deadly Mountains]] line the Northwest of Euyda, stretching from the Illisatic Ocean to the West and the Steaming Ocean to the North.
