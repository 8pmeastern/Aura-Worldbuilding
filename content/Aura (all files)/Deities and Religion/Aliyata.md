Aliyata are immortal 4D beings often referred to as gods by the people of [[Aura]]. They were created by [[The Three Eternals]] , as were all things. These gods can only die by being killed (no natural causes). Often, they are  remanifested by the Eternals if the Eternal chooses to use energy to do so. Aliyata are generally created to help the Eternals fulfill their purposes and visions for their creation.
